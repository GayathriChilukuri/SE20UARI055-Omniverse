Scenario: <br>
Imagine a busy traffic intersection with traffic lights. In this virtual place, we have a police officer and their patrol car as important elements. <br>
<br>

Use Cases: <br>
<br>
Planning for Emergencies: <br>
Picture a situation like a car crash or a fire at this busy intersection. We can use this virtual scene to plan how to manage traffic during such emergencies. It's like practicing to keep <br>people safe when something goes wrong on the road.<br>
<br>
Understanding Traffic:<br>
Think of it like a traffic game on the computer. We create a realistic busy intersection with the police officer. Then, we watch how cars and people move around. This helps us learn how<br> traffic works and how the police officer's presence can make traffic flow better and safer.<br>
